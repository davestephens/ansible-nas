# Blaze

Homepage: [https://github.com/blenderskool/blaze](https://github.com/blenderskool/blaze)

Blaze is a file sharing progressive web app(PWA) that allows users to transfer files between multiple devices. It works similar to SHAREit or the Files app by Google but uses web technologies to eliminate the process of installing native apps for different devices and operating systems. It also supports instant file sharing with multiple devices at once which many file sharing apps lack.

## Usage

Set `blaze_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/group_vars/nas.yml` file.
