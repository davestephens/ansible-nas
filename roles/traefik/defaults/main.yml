# External Access
# Traefik will allow access to certain applications externally. To enable this you'll either; a domain name that points to your
# home static IP address, the cloudflare with the cloudflare_ddns dynamic DNS container enabled, or use a dynamic DNS provider like no-ip.
# You'll also need to map ports 80 and 443 from your router to your ansible-nas server, then enable the per-app "available_externally"
# settings.
