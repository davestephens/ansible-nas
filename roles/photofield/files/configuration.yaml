render:
  # The area at which photos are rendered as a solid color.

  # Pre-generated thumbnail configuration, these thumbnails will be used to
  # greatly speed up the rendering
  thumbnails:

    # name: Short thumbnail type name
    #
    # path: Path template where to find the thumbnail.
    #   {{.Dir}} is replaced by the parent directory of the original photo
    #   {{.Filename}} is replaced by the original photo filename
    #
    # fit: Aspect ratio fit of the thumbnail in case it doesn't match the
    #      original photo.
    #
    #   INSIDE
    #     The thumbnail size is the maximum size of each dimension, so in case
    #     of different aspect ratios, one dimension will always be smaller.
    #
    #   OUTSIDE
    #     The thumbnail size is the minimum size of each dimension, so in case
    #     of different aspect ratios, one dimension will always be bigger.
    #
    #   ORIGINAL
    #     The size of the thumbnail is equal the size of the original. Mostly
    #     useful for transcoded or differently encoded files.
    #
    # width
    # height: Predefined thumbnail dimensions used to pick the most
    #         appropriately-sized thumbnail for the zoom level.
    #
    # extra_cost: Additional weight to add when picking the closest thumbnail.
    #             Higher number means that other thumbnails will be preferred
    #             if they exist.
