  # OliveTin can run long-running jobs like Ansible playbooks.
  #
  # For such jobs, you will need to install ansible-playbook on the host where
  # you are running OliveTin, or in the container.
  #
  # You probably want a much longer timeout as well (so that ansible completes).

  # OliveTin can control containers - docker is just a command line app.
  #
  # However, if you are running in a container you will need to do some setup,
  # see the docs below.
