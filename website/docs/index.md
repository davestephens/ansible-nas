# Introduction

After getting burned by broken FreeNAS updates one too many times, I figured I could do a much better job myself using just a stock Ubuntu install, some clever Ansible config and a bunch of Docker containers. Ansible-NAS was born!

## Getting Started

Head to the [installation](./getting-started/installation.md) guide to get started. Once you're done, check out how to [enable applications](./getting-started/enabling-applications.md), as well as how to enable [external access](./getting-started/external-access.md)
