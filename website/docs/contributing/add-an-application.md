# Add An Application

Adding a new application to Ansible-NAS is easy! First, set up your [development environment](./development-environment.md).

Then;

- Start by looking at the `hello_world` role - this includes everything that's expected to be included with a new application.
- Ensure the application includes tests and documentation. Tests should ensure that the application starts and stops correctly.
