Docker image: [Promtail](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/promtail)

Promtail is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private Grafana Loki instance or Grafana Cloud. It is usually deployed to every machine that has applications needed to be monitored.

It primarily:

- Discovers targets
- Attaches labels to log streams
- Pushes them to the Loki instance.

## Usage

Set `promtail_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/group_vars/nas.yml` file.
