Cloud Commander is a file manager for the web. It includes a command-line console and a text editor. Cloud Commander helps you manage your server and work with files, directories and programs in a web browser from any computer, mobile or tablet.

## Usage

Set `cloudcmd_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

By default your the root of your Ansible-NAS box (`/`) is mounted into `/mnt/fs` within the container. If you'd like to change this update `cloudcmd_browse_directory` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

If you enable external access to Cloud Commander (note that this is not recommended) then ensure you configure authorisation
within the application (F10 from the main menu).
