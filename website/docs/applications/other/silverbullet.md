SilverBullet is a note-taking application optimized for people with a
[hacker mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker). We all take notes.
There’s a million note taking applications out there. [Literally](https://www.noteapps.ca/).
Wouldn’t it be nice to have one where your notes are _more_ than plain text files?
Where your notes essentially become a _database_ that you can query; that you can build custom
knowledge applications on top of?

## Usage

Set `silverbullet_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/group_vars/nas.yml` file.

The Silverbullet web interface can be found at [http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:3002](http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:3002).

## Additional Configuration

Set `silverbullet_username` and `silverbullet_password` to customise the login username and password.
