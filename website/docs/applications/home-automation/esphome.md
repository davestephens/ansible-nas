ESPHome is a system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 by simple yet powerful configuration files and control them remotely through Home Automation systems

## Usage

Set `esphome_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

You can make esphome externally available, but the program has no security so this is strongly not advised
The EspHome web interface can be found at <http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:6052>.
