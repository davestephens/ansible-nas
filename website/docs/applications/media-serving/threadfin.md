Threadfin is a M3U proxy server for Plex, Emby, Jellyfin and any client and provider which supports the .TS and .M3U8 (HLS) streaming formats.

Threadfin emulates a SiliconDust HDHomeRun OTA tuner, which allows it to expose IPTV style channels to software, which would not normally support it.

## Usage

Set `threadfin_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/group_vars/nas.yml` file.

Access the webui at [http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:34400/web](http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:34400/web) by default. See specific configuration section below for information on setting up external access.
