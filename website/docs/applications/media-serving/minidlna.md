MiniDLNA is server software with the aim of being fully compliant with DLNA/UPnP clients. The MiniDNLA daemon serves media files (music, pictures, and video) to clients on a network. Example clients include applications such as Totem and Kodi, and devices such as portable media players, Smartphones, Televisions, and gaming systems (such as PS3 and Xbox 360).

## Usage

Set `minidlna_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/group_vars/nas.yml` file.

The very basic MiniDLNA web interface can be found at [http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:8201](http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:8201).
