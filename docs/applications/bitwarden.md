This is a Bitwarden server API implementation written in Rust compatible with upstream
Bitwarden clients\*, perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official
resource-heavy service might not be ideal.

## Usage

Set `bitwarden_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

## Specific Configuration

Make sure you set your admin token! It is `bitwarden_admin_token` in
`group_vars/all.yml` file. The string you put here will be the login to the admin
section of your Bitwarden installation (https://bitwarden.ansiblenasdomain.tld/admin).
This token can be anything, but it's recommended to use a long, randomly generated
string of characters, for example running: `openssl rand -base64 48`.

To create a user, you need to set `bitwarden_allow_signups` to `true` in your `all.yml`,
and re-run the playbook to reprovision the container. Once you've created your users,
set `bitwarden_allow_signups` back to `false` and run again.

For speed you can target just Bitwarden by appending `-t bitwarden` to your
`ansible-playbook` command.
