FileBot is the ultimate tool for organizing and renaming your Movies, TV Shows and Anime as well as fetching subtitles and artwork. It's smart and just works.


## Usage

Set `filebot_enabled: true` in your `group_vars/all.yml` file.

By default your media and downloads directories will be mounted inside the container; i.e. /downloads, /tv, /movies, /music.
