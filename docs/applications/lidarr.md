Lidarr is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor
multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will grab, sort and
rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files
already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

## Usage

Set `lidarr_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.
