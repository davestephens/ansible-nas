PyTivo is both an HMO and GoBack server. Similar to TiVo Desktop pyTivo
loads many standard video compression codecs and outputs mpeg2 video to
the TiVo. However, pyTivo is able to load MANY more file types than TiVo
Desktop. [http://pytivo.org/](http://pytivo.org/)

## Usage

web interface can be found at http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:9032.
