Homepage: [https://freshrss.org/](https://freshrss.org/)

A free, self-hostable aggregator probably the best!

## Usage

Set `freshrss_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

If you want to access FreshRSS externally, don't forget to set `freshrss_available_externally: "true"` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

The FreshRSS web interface can be found at http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:5805.
