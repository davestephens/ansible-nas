Airsonic is a free, web-based media streamer, providing ubiquitous access to your music.
Use it to share your music with friends, or to listen to your own music while at work.
You can stream to multiple players simultaneously, for instance to one player in your
kitchen and another in your living room

## Usage

Set `airsonic_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

The Airsonic web interface can be found at http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:4040.

## Specific Configuration

The default username and password is `admin` - you'll need to change this immediately
after logging in.
