# Samba Shares

Ansible-NAS uses the awesome
[bertvv.samba](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-samba) Ansible role to configure
Samba - check out the project page for the many different options you can use to
configure a share.

## Share Examples

Ansible-NAS shares are defined in the `samba_shares` section within
`group_vars/all.yml`. The examples provided are "public" shares that anyone on your LAN
can read and write to.

## File Permissions

Ansible-NAS creates an `ansible-nas` user and group on your server, which Samba will use
to access the data in your shares. New data created will be permissioned correctly.
However, if you have existing data this will need to be repermissioned so that Samba can
read and serve it. An playbook is provided to do this for you - `permission_data.yml`.
It is separated from the main Ansible-NAS playbook due to the time it can take to run
with large amounts of data. You should only need to run this once.
