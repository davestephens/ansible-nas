So you've installed Ansible-NAS. Now what?

The first thing to do is to configure [Heimdall](https://heimdall.site/) as the
dashboard of your new NAS, because most of the applications included come with a web
interface. Heimdall lets you create "apps" for them which appear as little icons on the
screen.

To add applications to Heimdall, you'll need the IP address of your NAS. If you don't
know it for some reason, you will have to look up using the console with `ip a`. The
entry "link/ether", usually the second one after the loopback device, will show the
address. Another alternative is to make sure [Avahi](https://www.avahi.org/) is
installed for zero-configuration networking (mDNS). This will allow you to `ssh` into
your NAS and with the extension `.local` to your machines name, such as
`ssh tardis.local`. Then you can use the `ip a` command again.

Next, you need the application's port, which you can look up in the
[list of ports](configuration/application_ports.md). You can test the combination of
address and port in your browser by typing them joined by a colon. For instance, for
Glances on a machine with the IPv4 address 192.168.1.2, the full address would be
`http://192.168.1.2:61208`. Once you are sure it works, use this address and port
combination when creating the Heimdall icon.

[Glances](https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/) and
[Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) are probably the two applications you want to add
to Heimdall first, so you can see what is happening on the NAS. Note that Portainer will
ask for your admin password. After that, it depends on what you have installed - see the
listing for individual applications for more information.
