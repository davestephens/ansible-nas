After getting burned by broken FreeNAS updates one too many times, I figured I could do
a much better job myself using just a stock Ubuntu install, some clever Ansible config
and a bunch of Docker containers. Ansible-NAS was born!

## Getting Started

Head to [installation](installation.md) if you're ready to roll, or to
[testing](testing.md) if you want to spin up a test Virtual Machine first. Once you're
done, check out the [post-installation](post_installation.md) steps.

If this is all very confusing, there is also an [overview](overview.md) of the project
and what is required for complete beginners. If you're only confused about ZFS, we'll
help you [get started](zfs/zfs_overview.md) as well.
