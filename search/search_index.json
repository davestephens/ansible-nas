The steps for deployment are exactly the same, just pay attention to editing the inventory file in step 7. Enable the Ubuntu Universe repository: sudo add-apt-repository universe Install Ansible: sudo apt install ansible git clone https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas.git cd ansible-nas Copy group_vars/all.yml.dist to group_vars/all.yml . Open up group_vars/all.yml and follow the instructions there for configuring your Ansible NAS. If you plan to use Transmission with OpenVPN, also copy group_vars/vpn_credentials.yml.dist to group_vars/vpn_credentials.yml and fill in your settings. Copy inventory.dist to inventory and update it. Install the dependent roles: ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml (you might need sudo to install Ansible roles) Run the playbook - something like ansible-playbook -i inventory nas.yml -b -K should do you nicely.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"support/","text":"Support Getting support for Ansible-NAS is easy!
