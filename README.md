After getting burned by broken FreeNAS updates one too many times, I figured I
could do a much better job myself using just a stock Ubuntu install, some clever
Ansible config and a bunch of Docker containers.

## What This Could Do

Ansible-NAS can run anything that's in a Docker image, which is why Portainer is
included. A NAS configuration is a pretty personal thing based on what you
download, what media you view, how many photos you take...so it's difficult to
please everyone.

That said, if specific functionality you want isn't included and you think
others could benefit, add it and raise a PR!

## What This Doesn't Do

Ansible NAS doesn't set up your disk partitions, primarily because getting it wrong can be incredibly destructive.
That aside, configuring partitions is usually a one-time (or very infrequent) event, so there's not much to be
gained by automating it. Check out the [docs](https://davestephens.github.io/ansible-nas) for recommended setups.

## Quick Start

:skull: Before running anything, check out the playbook and understand what it
does. Run it against a VM and make sure you're happy. ***Do not*** blindly
download code from the internet and trust that it's going to work as you expect.
:skull:

1. Enable the Ubuntu Universe repository: `sudo add-apt-repository universe`
2. Install Ansible: `sudo apt install ansible`
3. `git clone https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas.git && cd ansible-nas`
4. Copy `group_vars/all.yml.dist` to  `group_vars/all.yml`.
5. Open up `group_vars/all.yml` and follow the instructions there for configuring your Ansible NAS.
6. If you plan to use Transmission with OpenVPN, also copy `group_vars/vpn_credentials.yml.dist` to
`group_vars/vpn_credentials.yml` and fill in your settings.
7. Copy `inventory.dist` to `inventory` and update it.
8. Install the dependent roles: `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` (you might need sudo to install Ansible roles)
9. Run the playbook - something like `ansible-playbook -i inventory nas.yml -b -K` should do you nicely.

## Documentation

You can read the docs [here](https://davestephens.github.io/ansible-nas). PRs
for more documentation always welcome!

## Migrating from FreeNAS

Assuming that your Ubuntu system disk is separate from your storage (it should be!):

1. Ensure you have a working backup of your data.
2. Check that the working backup you think you have actually works.
3. SSH to the server and run `zpool list` to determine available ZFS pools.
4. `zpool import <pool_name>` against each of the pools you want to attach.
5. `chown -R root:root /mnt/<pool_name>` to fix the ownership of the data.
6. Follow the Quick Start instructions above.

## Requirements

* Ansible NAS targets the latest Ubuntu LTS release, which is currently Ubuntu
  Server 18.04.3 LTS.
* You can run Ansible-NAS on whatever you like, read the docs for more info. I
  use an HP Microserver.

## Getting Help

Getting help is easy! You can:

* Read the [docs](https://davestephens.github.io/ansible-nas)
* Raise an [issue](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas/issues)
* Chat on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Ansible-NAS/Chat)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, please feel free to raise a PR!

* Restrict pull requests to one piece of functionality or bugfix at a time.
* Test your new functionality or bugfix using the included
  `tests/test-vagrant.sh` script to spin up a test VM. Note that Ansible-NAS
  requires Vagrant version 2.2.2 or later, so for stock Ubuntu 18.04.2, you will
  have to download and install the newest version from
  https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html.
* Run `ansible-lint` against the playbook before committing. (There is a VSCode
  task set up to run the right command for you)
* Please know that your efforts are appreciated, thanks! :+1:

Development of Ansible-NAS is carried out in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - you'll get some nice
recommended extensions and task setups if you do the same.
